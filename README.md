This repository contains code and instructions for running an 8-bit LED module connected to pins 2, 3, 4, and 5 of an Arduino board. The project demonstrates basic LED control using Arduino's digital output pins.

*Requirements
  Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Mega, Nano)
  8-bit LED module
  Jumper wires
  USB cable for connecting Arduino to the computer
  Arduino IDE

*Wiring
  Connect the 8-bit LED module to the Arduino board as follows:

    LED1 -> Pin 2
    LED2 -> Pin 3
    LED3 -> Pin 4
    LED4 -> Pin 5
    LED5 -> Pin 6
    LED6 -> Pin 7
    LED7 -> Pin 8
    LED8 -> Pin 9
    GND -> GND

*Installation
  1.Download the Arduino IDE: If you don't have the Arduino IDE installed, download and install it from the Arduino website.
  2.Clone this repository: Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
  3.Open the Arduino IDE: Launch the Arduino IDE and open the 8bit_led_module.ino file from the cloned repository.

*Code
  The code to control the 8-bit LED module is provided in the 8bit_led_module.ino
  This code sequentially turns each LED on for 2000 milliseconds and then turns it off, creating a simple chasing effect.

*Uploading the Code
  1.Connect your Arduino: Use the USB cable to connect your Arduino board to your computer.
  2.Select your board and port: In the Arduino IDE, go to Tools > Board and select your Arduino board. Then, go to Tools > Port and select the correct port for your Arduino.
  3.Upload the code: Click the upload button (right arrow) in the Arduino IDE to compile and upload the code to your Arduino board.

*Usage
  Once the code is uploaded, the 8-bit LED module should start running the sequence described in the loop function. Each LED will light up in sequence with a delay of 500 milliseconds between each step.
